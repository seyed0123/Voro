# Voro

**Voro** is a simple yet strategic multiplayer web game.
The rules are easy to learn, but mastering it takes time and clever tactics.

### 🎮 How to Play

* Click on a circle to increase its count by one.
* When a circle reaches **4**, it **explodes** and sends one unit to each of its four neighboring circles.
* These chain reactions can lead to strategic captures and dynamic shifts on the board.
* Anyone of any age can learn the game in minutes — but mastering strategies can take a lifetime.
